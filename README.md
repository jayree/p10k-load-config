# p10k-load-config

Loads the configuration of Powerlevel10k.

[Powerlevel10k configuration wizard][1] will ask you a few questions and configure your prompt. If it doesn't trigger automatically, type `p10k configure`. You can further customize your prompt by editing `~/.p10k.zsh`.

When the wizard asks the question, `Apply changes to ~/.zshrc?` \
Choose `(n)  No. I know which changes to apply and will do it myself.` 

This module must be loaded **before** the *[sfdx][2]* module.
